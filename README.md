- added a footer
- stickiness of nav does not use a scroll listener
- wasn't sure if those cards should've been links
- show how to display grid
- didn't want to animate absolutely everything
- email form "works" in that it shows an error and success, but doesn't actually submit anywhere
- nice to have: don't show email signup form on every page request during same session
- didn't see a need for anything other than vanilla, other than maybe the email signup form
- kept the code really simple, don't like importing libraries needlessly
- mobile nav is a11y-friendly: traps keyboard focus, has appropriate aria labels, esc key closes it

TODO:

- animate main title
- animate checkmarks and selling points
- animate hero image
- animate bra cups
- cleanup readme
